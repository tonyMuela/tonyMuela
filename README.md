- 🐍 I've worked with a few other coding languages (Python, Swift, C#) but web development is just a lot more fun.
- 📺 I watched Silicon Valley and went "OOh, that looks cool. I want to do that."
- 🐍 I've worked with a few other coding languages (Python, Swift, C#) but python just hits different.
- 💻 I've also done some web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript). It's the perfect blend of creative and problem solving.
- 🧮 I do really like Python though. It lets me flex my math skills.
