## Hi, I'm Tony Muela
- 📊 I discovered Data Analytics and it was like someone tailored a job just for me.
- 🐍 I've worked with a few different coding languages (Python, Swift, C#, C++, JavaScript) but Python just feels right.
- 📺 I watched Silicon Valley and went "OOh, that looks cool. I want to do that."
